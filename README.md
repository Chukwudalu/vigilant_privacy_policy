# Privacy Policy for Vigilant
Last Updated: January 4, 2026

1. ### Introduction
Welcome to Vigilant. We are committed to protecting your privacy while providing robust phishing and malware detection. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data.

2. ### Information Collection and Use
Vigilant requires specific permissions to function effectively. Here is how we use them:

Browsing History: We access your local browsing history to identify "homoglyph" or "typosquatting" attacks (e.g., detecting if a site is trying to impersonate a domain you have visited before).

URL Analysis: The extension analyzes the URL entered in the input box  to check against security databases (like Google Safe Browsing) and our internal heuristic and machine learning models.

3. ### Data Storage and Privacy
We believe in Local-First security.

Local Processing: Most of the analysis, including history comparison and heuristic checks, happens directly on your device.

No Data Selling: We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal browsing data or history to third parties.

Transmission: If a URL is sent to an external API (like Google Safe Browsing or our ML endpoint) for verification, only the URL/Domain is sent. We do not send your identity, account information, or personal history logs.

4. ### Permissions Breakdown
history: Used solely to compare the current URL against your past visited sites to detect impersonation.

5. ### Third-Party Services
Vigilant may interact with the following services to verify site safety:

Google Safe Browsing API: To check URLs against known malware/phishing lists.

Internal ML Endpoint: To analyze URL features for new, unknown threats.

6. ### Data Retention
Because Vigilant primarily processes data in real-time and locally, we do not maintain a permanent database of your browsing habits on our servers.

7. ### Changes to This Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this document.
